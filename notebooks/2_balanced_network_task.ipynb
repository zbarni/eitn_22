    "# Introduction\n",
    "In order to understand the inner workings of neuronal circuits, one ansatz is to build and study computer models of such circuits. In those models we try to create carefully designed reduced models of complex structures, taking into account only what we believe is important to address a certain scientific question. If the reduced model is able to reproduce certain properties of the more complex system, one can hope that analyzing the model further might reveal answers to those questions or generate hypothesis which then can be experimentally tested.\n",
    "In this introductory part of the NEST project we will investigate a basic model of a cortical circuit. But in order to assess whether the model reasonably reproduces dynamical features of cortical circuits, we need to know how the dynamics in those circuits looks like.\n",
